### IO Information

* **`3V3`** - Provides up to `2A` of `3.3V` power from the onboard switching power supply.
* **`VBUS`** - Provides a `5V` reference signal from the USB `5V` rail only when `3V3_EN` is enabled (pulled-high). Connect to the `USB_VBUS` pin on the Core-Compute module.
* **`3V3_EN`** - Enables the `3.3V` switching power supply. Pull to ground to turn disable.
* **`F7_RST`** - Connected to the `RESET` button on the board. Connect to the `F7_RST` IO on the Core-Compute to provide reset via button functionality.
* **`USB_D_P` & `USB_D_N`** - USB differential pairs. Requires a `90Î©` controlled-impedance differential pair to the Core-Compute module.
* **`F7_Boot`** - Connected to the `BOOT` button on the board. Connect to the `F7_Boot` IO on the Core-Compute to provide DFU boot capabiltiies.
* **`5V`** - Connection to the `5V` power supply from the USB (via a diode).

### Power

Includes an `TPS54329EDDA` switching power supply that outputs up to `3A` of `3.3V` voltage, as well as passing through `5V` from the USB.

### Reference Application

For minimum functionality, please refer to the following reference application:

#### Enable Switch

To use an enable switch with the module, wire up a switch that pulls the `3V3_EN` pin to `GND` in order to turn off:

## Release Notes

### v4.a

BREAKING CHANGE: Added `VBUS` so that the solar battery charger could know when to disconnect battery

### v3.a

Switched to another DC Switching Buck that accepts a lower input voltage to enable it to run from battery

### v2.b

* Fixed `MCU_VBUS` bug in which an external 5V power source would pull it high.
* Added a power filter cap to USB power.

### v2.a

Updated power supply and MOSFET that had gone obsolete/EoL. 

### v1.d

This revision optimized the layout of the board to move the `BOOT` and `RST` buttons closer to the USB connector so designs that used this could cover the rest of the board. 

### v1.c

This revision changed the design to prevent the 3V3 and 5V diodes from draining power when it was installed on a battery powered board.

* Removed `3V3` LED.
* Added diode to prevent backfeeding to USB.

### v1.b

* Initial check-in
